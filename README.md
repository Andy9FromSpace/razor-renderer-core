# razor-renderer-core

Rendering pre-compiled razor templates in a .NET core command line application.

This project is based on https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy/tree/master/samples/Mvc.RenderViewToString but with nicely separated projects and an updated renderer.

Rendering that way works great in Azure Functions.
