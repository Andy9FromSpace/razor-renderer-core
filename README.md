# razor-renderer-core

Rendering pre-compiled razor templates in a .NET core command line application.

This project is based on https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy/tree/master/samples/Mvc.RenderViewToString but with nicely separated projects and a slightly updated renderer. Also dependencies have been stripped down, but there are still too many mvc related services being added for just rendering razor templates.
